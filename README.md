# U Pee N Piss
UPNP for Fabric Minecraft Servers

Automatically forwards port 25565 when your server starts, and closes it when the server closes.

You can use an online port checker to check if the port is open, such as https://portchecker.co/

The port may be left open if the server closes unexpectedly. If this happens, restarting and stopping the server will close the port.
